                <p>
                  Networking is the process of recruiting people and making a
                  commission from each person you recruit. This process helps
                  Fyre Skin increase sales force and helps you build a team that
                  comprises of your downlines whom you’re going to help secure
                  financial freedom by mentoring them. The beauty of our
                  networking scheme is you only get a one-off 20% Recruitment
                  bonus from people whom you directly recruit and you make
                  nothing from anyone they recruit. You can recruit as many
                  people as you want using your own link.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span>Please Note:</span> Unlike the regular Network marketing
                  pyramid scheme that requires you to bring a lot of people in
                  the <span>3-legs formation</span> in order for you to make
                  money and move up in rank, leaving those at the bottom with
                  nothing, the Fyre Skin brand partnership program is designed
                  in a unique model that makes sure you don’t need people in
                  order for you to make an income or move up in rank. What we
                  offer is the <span>direct networking</span>, you only get a
                  commission for anyone whom you directly recruit and you have
                  no commission from any one your downlines recruits .

                <p>
                  <span>How networking works: </span>Brand partners make 20%
                  from signup fee per every person they recruit. Signup fee is
                  25,000.

                  doesn’t affects your downlines commission.
