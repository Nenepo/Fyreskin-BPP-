                is the <span>direct networking</span>, you only get a commission for anyone whom you directly recruit and you have no commission from any one
                your downlines recruits .
                </p>
                <p><span>How networking works: </span>Brand partners make 20% from signup fee per every person they recruit. Signup fee is 25,000.

                <p>5000 x 8 people = 40,000</p>
                <p>Ade made 40,000 in recruitment bonus.
                </p>
